# job-description-classification
Presented with a multi-class prediction challenge: given a job description, the goal is to predict one of six possible labels. As part of the challenge, we were also asked to identify what the six classes represent.

First, we used a state-of-the-art classification model called SetFit. After we saw which classes the model struggled with, we proceeded on to figure out what the classes mean.
